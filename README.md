# 🧬 Genome Sequencing Using NLP  
*A Machine Learning & Deep Learning Project for Promoter Region Classification*

This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to **genomic DNA sequences** to classify promoter vs. non-promoter regions.  
By treating DNA sequences as biological text, we unlock new pathways for scalable and accurate genomic analysis.

## ⭐ Overview

- **Goal:** Predict whether a genomic DNA sequence is a **promoter** or **non-promoter** region  
- **Dataset:** 22,598 labeled FASTA sequences from *Drosophila Melanogaster*  
- **Approach:** NLP tokenization (k-mers), ML & DL models, ensemble learning  
- **Best Model:** **CNN with one-hot encoded k-mers (k=6)**  
- **Best Accuracy:** **91.3%**

## 🧠 Motivation

Promoter regions control gene expression and are essential to understanding biological regulation.  
Traditional lab-based methods (DNase footprinting, ChIP-seq) are **accurate but expensive and slow**.

Using **NLP + ML**, we create an **automated, scalable, cost-effective** system that analyzes DNA sequences as text patterns, enabling rapid genomic discovery and computational biology research.
